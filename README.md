# TryToDie

Unity game made during a 48h gamejam which theme was "What do we know ?"

we wanted to question the fact that when a player enters a game, his past experiences influence him and his goals. 

Here, unlike a lot of famous games, the goal of the player is to die and not to survive. He goes through multiple rooms in which he has to find out how to die.
